## 1. Summary 

##### Problem Statement

The pandemic has shown the current limitations of ventilators because of it's intesenive, manual procedure. 
Ventilators are used as a last resort for clinicians, to manually pump oxygen into a patient's lung. 


Machine learning can help reduce barrier of developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators. 
This will greatly benefit clinicians by giving them an effective instrument and hopefully reduce the burden of them during these times.
As a result, ventilator treatments may become more widely available to help patients breathe.

##### Technical Overview
The dataset is comprised of numerous time series of breaths. So I decide to construct a RNN with GRU units. LSTM units usually outperform GRU, however
GRUs train faster, since they have one less gate to tune. In practice, GRU and LSTM models are both trained to see which one yields better results. I also tried training a LightGBM model, but it was unable to keep up with the GRU.

## 2. Results
Here the GRU actually performed fairly well against LTSM models on Kaggle. Even though the GRU was out performed by LSTM, I was still able to obrtain good results with a simplier model. Unfortunately, I was not able to save my model, since the kernel froze. However, I was still able to submit my results in the competition. 

I created a correlation matrix to see if I can get any insights about the target variables or the features.

I performed cross validations 5 times. Below is the plotted loss fucntion on one fold. After ~120 epochs, the model starts overfitting so training stops.

Here is the learning rate plotted

Overall I am pretty satisfied with my results. If this model was applied to medical practioners, it would serve as a strong baseline to what the next generation mechanical ventalitors can do. Ventilators can be the difference from life or death so having the best medical equipment is imperative to combat COVID-19.
 
## 3. Data Description

- id - globally-unique time step identifier across an entire file

- breath_id - globally-unique time step for breaths

- R - lung attribute indicating how restricted the airway is (in cmH2O/L/S). Physically, this is the change in pressure per change in flow (air volume per time). Intuitively, one can imagine blowing up a balloon through a straw. We can change R by changing the diameter of the straw, with higher R being harder to blow.

- C - lung attribute indicating how compliant the lung is (in mL/cmH2O). Physically, this is the change in volume per change in pressure. Intuitively, one can imagine the same balloon example. We can change C by changing the thickness of the balloonâ€™s latex, with higher C having thinner latex and easier to blow.

- time_step - the actual time stamp.

- u_in - the control input for the inspiratory solenoid valve. Ranges from 0 to 100.

- u_out - the control input for the exploratory solenoid valve. Either 0 or 1.

*Target Variable*
- pressure - the airway pressure measured in the respiratory circuit, measured in cmH2O.
